## About Whistler

**Hello.**

I am wisty (in lowercase)! I like to write all sorts of things. Pronouns are she/her.

The name is a pun on Windows Whistler. I am not affiliated with Microsoft.

You can commission my writing if you want! I'll put a link here eventually.

Discord: `wistlyr#6900`

I help with [NETeSCAPE](https://netescape.org) too, by the way. Check them out!
